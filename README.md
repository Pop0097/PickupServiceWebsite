# Pickup_Service_Website
A template website for a cuisine pickup/takeout service. I made this template for my uncle as a present. (All relevant text and images will be added privately by my uncle and thus won't be visible on this repository). 


# How to deploy the website 
(Pre-domain purchase)

1. Download a zip of the repository by clicking "clone or download" (the green button) and then "Download ZIP." (See NOTE)
2. Once the repository is downloaded, enter the folder and click on the file "index.html." The file will open the website in your preferred browser. 
3. Use the website and enjoy :))

NOTE: if you are using Windows, make sure you extract the files from the ZIP before proceeding to the next steps. 


## Reflection

# Next steps for the website
1. I will work with the recipient to create media (texts and images) for the website. (See NOTE)
2. I will transfer all ownership (emailjs templates and emails) to my uncle. 
3. I will purchase a domain name to host the website. 
4. I will work as the website maintainer, updating media and fixing bugs when needed. 


# What I learned from this process
When I started developing this website, I had little experience developing with JavaScript (JS). Working on this project required me to relearn the fundamentals of JS, which will definitely help me when I start other projects. Additionally, previously my front-end development was rather poor because I would struggle with making my websites mobile-friendly. Through making this website, I learned how to use Bootstrap, which enabled me to singificantly improve my front-end development skills. Finally, this website implements emailjs to send emails. Using third party services to add features to my website was always something that intimidated me in the past. Applying emailjs to this website has increased my confidence in this area.
