# PickupServiceWebsite
A website for a cuisine pickup/takeout service. I made this for my uncle (who is a great chef) as a present. The website displays the dishes my uncle offers and allows users to place orders as well.

# How to deploy the website 
(Pre-domain purchase)

1. Download a zip of the repository by clicking "clone or download" (the green button) and then "Download ZIP." 
2. Once the repository is downloaded, enter the folder and click on the file "index.html." The file will open the website in your preferred browser. 
3. Use the website and enjoy :))
